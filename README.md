# Arduino-Christmas-Lights

This project combines festive Christmas lights with a buzzer that plays the melody of *Jingle Bells*.  
Each LED lights up depending on the musical note currently being played by the buzzer, creating a synchronised visual‑audio effect.

## Requirements

- 1 active or passive buzzer  
- Multiple LEDs (any colours you prefer for the Christmas theme)  
- 1 × 220Ω resistor for each LED  
- 1 breadboard  
- Jumper wires  
- 1 Arduino UNO board  

## Description

The Arduino plays the melody of *Jingle Bells* using the buzzer.  
For every musical note in the melody, a specific LED turns on.  
This creates a simple but charming Christmas light show where:

- Each note corresponds to one LED  
- LEDs turn on only while their assigned note is being played  
- The sequence of lights follows the rhythm of the song  

This project is ideal for learning about tone generation, timing, and mapping musical notes to visual outputs.

You can expand this project by adding more LEDs, using RGB LEDs, or synchronising multiple light patterns for different sections of the melody.
